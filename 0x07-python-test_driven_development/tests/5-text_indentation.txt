How to Use 5-text_indentation.py
=======================================

This module defines a function ``text_indentation(text)``.

Usage
=====

``text_indentation(...)``` prints a modified version of the provided text. The function inserts 2 new lines
after each occurrence of the characters `.` (period), `?` (question mark), and `:` (colon).

::

    >>> text_indentation = __import__('5-text_indentation').text_indentation
    >>> text = "This is a sample text. It has sentences with dots. And also some questions? And maybe a few colons: like this one."
    >>> text_indentation(text)
    This is a sample text.

    It has sentences with dots.

    And also some questions?

    And maybe a few colons:

    Like this one.

Non-String Text
================

``text_indentation()`` expects that the provided text is a string.
If the text is not a string, a ``TypeError`` is raised:

::

    >>> text_indentation(123)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    TypeError: text must be a string

::

    >>> text_indentation(['This', 'is', 'a', 'list'])
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    TypeError: text must be a string

No Occurrence of ., ?, or :
==========================

If the provided text does not contain any occurrences of `.`, `?`, or `:`, the original text is printed:

::

    >>> text_indentation("This text has no special characters")
    This text has no special characters
